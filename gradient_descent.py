# Description: Generates an initial random solution S. For each k iterations, considers a random move
# to a neighbor S' of the current solution S. If the residue r(S') is less than r(S), sets S to S'
# returns the final and best S.
# The random move defined for gradient descent is as follows: choose random i and j from [1,n] s.t. i != j
# Set S_i to -S_i and with probability 1/2 set S_j to -S_j
